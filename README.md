Hello there, Sprinter is a simple search engine that can query results for images, news and videos.

It uses RapidApi to fetch data from google searches.

Tailwind CSS is been used for the styling of the web app. 

This project sharpens basic and important concepts of react hooks and context. A good understanding of APIs and routing is essential for this mini-project.

New features  will be added soon.
